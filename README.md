# Weather
A short and sweet command line Weather info tool for Windows.

To get info, run 'weather' followed by the city which you want weather information about.
Without any arguments, default weather is for london.

For simplest use, add to 'C:\Users\[Name]\" and run from CMD.
For full integration, add to PATH Environment Variables.
